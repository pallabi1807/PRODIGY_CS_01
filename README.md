# PRODIGY_CS_01
## 🎯 Aim
To create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the *Caesar Cipher algorithm*, allowing users to input a message and a shift value.

---

## 🧠 Objective
The objective of this project is to demonstrate a simple encryption technique where each letter in the message is replaced by another letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

---

## 🏢 Internship Task
This project is part of the *Prodigy InfoTech Internship Program (Cybersecurity Domain)*.  
It was developed as one of the assigned tasks to implement basic encryption and decryption using Python.

---

## ⚙ Working
- The user enters a text message and a shift value.  
- Each letter is shifted forward by the given number for *encryption*.  
- The process is reversed for *decryption* using the same shift value.  
- Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.

---

## 💻 Steps to Run
1. Install *Python 3* on your system.  
2. Open the code file in *VS Code* or any Python IDE.  
3. Run the program using: python caesars.py
4. Enter the message and shift value when prompted.

## 🧩 Example Output
Enter your message: Hello World
Enter shift value (e.g. 3): 3
Encrypted message: Khoor Zruog
Decrypted message: Hello World
